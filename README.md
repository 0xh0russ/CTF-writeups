# CTF-Notes
**TLDR: these writeups include *all* my attempts, if the file is too long scroll all the way down the md file to find the approach that worked**

## What this is

This is a collection of notes that I write *while* doing ctf problems. Usually writeups walk you through solutions to problem in a direct, straight-forward way. They are also written after the author has already solved the problem.

Even though I am relatively new to CTFs, what I am trying to accomplish here is provide absolute beginners with a resource that shows the complete process of solving a problem. This means that I will be trying to document my entire thought process including failed attempts and dead ends. 

To achieve this, I am going to be writing these as I work through the challenges which means that they will be a *little* all over the place.

## Organization

The organization is pretty self-explanatory.
- All my notes will be in the notes directory, they will all be in markdown.
	- notes/\<ctf-name\>/\<challenge\>.md
- All challenge files will be found in the files directory
	- files/\<ctf-name\>/\<challenge\>/\*
