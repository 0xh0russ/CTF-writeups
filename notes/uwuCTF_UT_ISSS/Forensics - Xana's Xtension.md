#### Hints
\[None\]

## Provided Files

- code_lyoko.txt
	- apparently a text file, i haven't looked yet but from the challenge name I'm guessing this its not really.

## Write Up

- lets first inspect what is in the text file.
	- just outputs a lot of junk. ðŸ˜¯
	- lets see what it is really using the file command: `file code_lyoko.txt`
		- its actually a GIF.
	- open it using xviewer, or change the extension to `.gif` so you can just click it.
		- `xviewer code_lyoko.txt`
	- we get this nice gif, here's the flag.
