# \[Forensics\] - Fake Geoguesser

#### Points = 122

## Prompt

We don't do guess challs here at TJCTF, so that means no Geoguessr üòû Since I took this photo myself, though, you can find out precisely where it was taken, and some Bonus Content‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, from my Camera Model Name to the Circle Of Confusion. Maybe you'll find a flag there?

## Provided Files

- `lake.jpg` - JPEG image of a lake

## Write Up

- Forensics challenges are guessy in the beginning so we just start with basic commands.
- first we run file to make sure its actually a JPEG:
![file|650](geo_file.png)
	- ok, checks out
- now lets see if the flag is included as a string
![file|650](geo_strings.png)
	 - this reveals our flag
