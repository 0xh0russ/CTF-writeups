# \[Crypto\] - Flimsy Fingered Latin Teacher

#### Points = 133

## Prompt

Oh no! My Latin teacher likes to touch type on her Dell laptop, but she has trouble keeping her fingers on the right keys in home row. The letters she's typing out don't really make sense. Can you help me understand what she's saying so she doesn't get upset when I come to her confused?

## Write Up

- from the prompt it seems like all the letters are off by one on the teacher's keyboard
	- lets hope they're using QWERTY 
- the first few chars translate to `tjctf` if you for each character in the string, you type the character to its left on a QWERTY keyboard.
